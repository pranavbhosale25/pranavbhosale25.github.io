Hello there! I'm Pranav - a software engineer with over four years of experience. 

I am passionate about climate-change and I look forward to making meaningful contributions at the intersection of technology and climate change. 

I enjoy running. I took this up in college and started running more often over the past year. Most recently I completed my very first half marathon! I love hiking, trekking and almost anything outdoors! I enjoy visiting museums, reading books and sometimes solving word-puzzles and crosswords. I have also been volunteering since the past 7 years towards education, upskilling and climate-tech.

I have lived and loved the cities of Mumbai, Goa and finally Bangalore (where I currently reside).
